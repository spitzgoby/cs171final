        <h2>The Changing Face of Substance Abuse in America</h2>
        <p>
          The abuse of opioid medications , such Oxycontin®, Vicodin®, and Demerol® has dramatically increased in recent
          years. Unintentional poisoning deaths from prescription opioids has increased 400% from 1999 to 2010 and now
          outnumber those from heroin and cocaine combined <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/heroin/how-heroin-linked-to-prescription-drug-abuse" data-toggle="tooltip" title="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/heroin/how-heroin-linked-to-prescription-drug-abuse">(4)</a>.
          From 2003 to 2013 the number of people seeking treatment
          for synthetic opioids other than methadone increased 300%  <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/2013_Treatment_Episode_Data_Set_National/2013_Treatment_Episode_Data_Set_National_Tables.html" data-toggle="tooltip" title="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/2013_Treatment_Episode_Data_Set_National/2013_Treatment_Episode_Data_Set_National_Tables.html">(5)</a>
          . People may assume prescription pain relievers
          are less dangerous than illegal drugs because a doctor prescribes them, but when abused, these drugs can
          result in addiction, overdose, and death, especially if combined with other drugs or alcohol.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is concern that abuse of prescription opioids may ultimately lead to heroin use. From a recent study
          “Nearly half of young people who inject heroin surveyed in recent studies reported abusing prescription
          opioids before starting to use heroin. Some individuals reported switching to heroin because it is cheaper and
          easier to obtain than prescription opioids” <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Pollini, R.A.; Banta-Green, C.J.; Cuevas-Mota, J.; Metzner, M.; Teshale, E.; and Garfein, R.S.

        <h2>Opioids</h2>
        <p>
          Opioids include any substance that acts on opioid receptors in the brain. Opium, an opioid in use since
          antiquity is the forerunner of morphine and heroin. Morphine rose to prominence in the early 19th
          century due to its miraculous ability to eliminate sever pain, the addictive qualities of Morphine did not go
          unnoticed. In the second half of the 19th century, Bayer, a German pharmaceutical company discovered and
          patented heroin, and declared it a safer less addictive alternative to morphine for the management of sever
          pain. Pain management remains the most common medical use of opioids. In the modern era we have a greater
          selection of opioids, including synthetic and semi-synthetics variants such codeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone
          and fentanyl, but the dangers and challenges of addiction remain. <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/testimony-to-congress/2016/americas-addiction-to-opioids-heroin-prescription-drug-abuse" data-toggle="tooltip" title="https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/testimony-to-congress/2016/americas-addiction-to-opioids-heroin-prescription-drug-abuse">(7)</a></p>

                    <p> It takes some time before economic factors begin to have 
                      an effect on death rates. A person may begin using drugs 
                      as the result of job loss and not pass away for several years.
                      Conversely an upswing in median income would take several 
                      years to manifest in itself in lower death rates. The

          From 2003 until 2013, the years for which data is available, there was a pronounced change in the types of
          substances American’s were seeking treatment for. Treatment for cocaine, and crack cocaine peaked in 2006,
          with over 270 000 people seeking in treatment, but by 2013 the number seeking treatment had dropped to less
          than 103 000. In fact every substance tracked is at or near a ten year low for admission to treatment programs
          with one exception, opioids.  In 2013 the number of people seeking treatment for addiction to opioids, which
          includes substances such as heroin, methadone, and morphine had increased by over 45% since 2004. Those
          seeking treatment for heroin and methadone has remain relatively constant, and all of the growth has been
          those seeking treatment for addiction to synthetic opioids, which is composed of prescription pain medication

        <h2>Hope</h2>
        <p>
          The rising rates of addiction and death surrounding opioids paint a bleak picture, but there is hope. The
          federal government is starting to take action. In 2015 the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) created
          targeted initiates intended to reduce overdoses and addiction to prescription opioids and heroin. President
          Obama’s 2016 budget contains $133 million in net new funding for efforts aimed to reduce the abuse and misuse
          of opioids.

          The HHS’s has identified three priority areas that directly confront the current opioid crisis <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2015/03/26/hhs-takes-strong-steps-to-address-opioid-drug-related-overdose-death-and-dependence.html"  data-toggle="tooltip" title="http://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2015/03/26/hhs-takes-strong-steps-to-address-opioid-drug-related-overdose-death-and-dependence.html">(10)</a>.
          <ul>
            <li>“Providing training and educational resources, including updated prescriber guidelines, to assist health professionals in making informed prescribing decisions and address the over-prescribing of opioids."</li>

            <li>"Increasing use of naloxone, as well as continuing to support the development and distribution of the life-saving drug, to help reduce the number of deaths associated with prescription opioid and heroin overdose."</li>

            <li>"Expanding the use of Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT), a comprehensive way to address the needs of individuals that combines the use of medication with counseling and behavioral therapies to treat substance use disorders.”</li>
          </ul>
        The War on drugs has been costly in terms of money spent and the number of lives shattered and lost due to substance abuse. Rather than focusing on drug users as people to be persecuted and prosecuted, our laws and policies need to be reformed with a more compassionate approach that seeks to prevent and treat addiction rather than punish it.
